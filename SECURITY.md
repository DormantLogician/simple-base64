### Reporting a Vulnerability

Under 'Security' tab of repository, select 'Report a vulnerability', and fill out security advisory form - please provide as much detail as possible about the issue so it may be handled properly.

If advisory is accepted, provisions will be made to repair defects that cause the vulnerability - otherwise, issues mentioned in advisory might still be fixed, even if they are determined to not be causing a vulnerability, but advisory form should still only be used for reporting reporting security vulnerabilities.

Processing of advisory may take at most 1 to 2 weeks.
